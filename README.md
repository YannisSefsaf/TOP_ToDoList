<h1>ToDoList App</h1>
<p>This project is a TodoList App developed as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The application uses object-oriented programming (classes) and Webpack bundling. It allows users to keep track of their tasks based on due date, project, priority, and status. The app includes features such as sorting tasks by various criteria, adding, editing and deleting tasks and projects, as well as mobile responsiveness. Local storage is implemented so that the users can retrieve their projects and todos even after reloading the page.</p>
